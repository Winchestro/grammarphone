L system editor and audio visualizer I wrote over the course of a week.


-TODO:
	-Refactor/Clean up code to require
	-Implement Gallery

-Long-term-goals:
	-Sharing options

I would like to add some cc music but my internet is currently slow so I can't do the research.

Meanwhile you have to use the file picker to load songs from your local file system if you want to visualize. I hope it's not too bad.
